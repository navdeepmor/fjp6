# class and Objects (Encapsulation)
    Person
    Reference Vs Instance
    Swap1 - p1 & p2 swap via temp
    Swap2 - p1 & p2 swap via properties
    Games in Swap2 - new p1 and p2
# Miscellaneous
    static & non-static - BankAccount story 
        static vs non-static data members
        static fns - no "this", only static data members
        non-static fns - this, all data members
    Inheritance and Polymorphism
        P, C - all cases except abstract and final   
    final - variables and data members
    Object creation - steps, this, this chaining
        Space allocation - java Defaults
        Parsing - Non-dynamic Class creator Defaults
        Default ctor - Dynamic Class creator Defaults
        Parametrized ctor - Class user Defaults
    -------------------------------------------------   
    super and override, ctor chaining
    access modifiers - private, public, default, protected
    inheritance and static fns
    abstract & final - fns, class
    interfaces - comparator, comparable, iterator, iterable
        Object - toString, equals, hashcode
    Integer vs int, Integer[] vs int[]
    lamdba functions
    Jargon - encapsulation, data hiding, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism,

# Ref.

# JAVA - only can by value
# we don't have cal by ref. in JAVA because we don't have pointers in JAVA. Pointer complexity is handle by JAVA.
# in JAVA String are immutable but there ref. is mutable
# call by ref.
    when we passes address of stack
